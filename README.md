# E2 sim fork for ns-O-RAN

================================

This repository is a fork of the OSC [e2sim](https://github.com/o-ran-sc/sim-e2-interface) library with updates to make it work with the [ns3-o-ran-e2](https://github.com/o-ran-sc/sim-ns3-o-ran-e2) ns-3 module.

This module enables the support for running multiple terminations of an O-RAN-compliant E2 interface inside the simulation process. It has been developed as part of a collaborative effort between the [Institute for the Wireless Internet of Things (WIoT)](https://wiot.northeastern.edu) at Northeastern University, Mavenir, the University of Padova and Sapienza, University of Rome.

## How to use

Please refer to this [quick start guide](https://openrangym.com/tutorials/ns-o-ran) to setup the environment.
